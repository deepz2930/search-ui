# 🔍 Search Results Animation (React + Tailwind + Framer Motion)

A front-end implementation of the **Search Results UI + Animation** inspired by the Dribbble shot by [Shuma87](https://dribbble.com/shots/17399694-Search-Results-Animation).

This project was built using **React.js**, **Vite**, **TailwindCSS**, **Framer Motion**, and **Lucide React** (for icons).  
The goal was to recreate the **UI, UX, and animations** as closely as possible, without relying on UI component libraries.
